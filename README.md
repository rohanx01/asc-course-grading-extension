# ASC Grade Helper - Chrome Extension

**ASC Grade Helper** is a browser extension designed to enhance the experience of students at **IIT Bombay** by automating the tedious process of fetching and analyzing course grading statistics from the Application Software Centre (**ASC**).  

This tool provides a modern, user-friendly interface to quickly visualize and compare grade distributions for multiple courses across several years, saving students valuable time during course registration and academic planning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

![ASC Grade Helper in Action](demo.gif)

The extension uses an **In-Page Automation** architecture.  

When you request grade stats, a script is injected into your active, logged-in ASC portal page. This script:  

1. Takes your list of courses, years, and semesters.  
2. Programmatically clicks the **"Grading statistics"** link in the menu frame.  
3. For each course, fills out the search form and submits it.  
4. Waits for the results page to load in the content frame and scrapes the grade table HTML.  
5. After all courses are processed, navigates the content frame back to its original page.  
6. Sends the collected data back to the popup, where it is parsed and rendered as charts.  

‚úÖ This method is robust as it works within the website‚Äôs complex frameset structure and respects its security measures by automating real user actions.
